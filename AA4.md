2. First. let the set of 's subgroup in is , the set of subgroups of is .
is the image under . is the subgroup of , which
is where is the natural homomorphism from to .
Reversely, let The set of 's original image of .
.
And , . So so is the subgroup of . So
is the injective from to .
From , we have . Let , we have .
if , we have s.t. . So that
. establish a one on
one injection form to
Then let and if , we have
. Notice that is surjective, , reversely, if
and let we have .
so that so that , thus the subgroup is injected to subgroup.
Finally, let and from above we have Let be the natural
isomorphism from to , and be the natural isomorphism from to
. We have
= So
that the figure is satisfied, and
2.a.
Suppose and are the adjacency matrices of and its complement. Since is self-
complementary, there is a permutation matrix such that Now if is the all-ones
matrix then and so we find that This implies that
represents an automorphism of And , thus is a group.
b.
c.
3. where and
is called the dihedral group of degree This group contains the subgroup
where Since is its own centralizer in any element of which is
not in does not commute with But then, if we must have
otherwise, which implies inductively that and hence that
i.e., that It follows inductively that
Thus for and for which imply
that Moreover, any function defined in this way is in It follows that
and hence that is a normal subgroup of Thus is generated by and any
element not in Moreover, Hence where
is the homomorphism defined by It follows that has
the presentation . since any group having
these generators and relations is of order at most Indeed, the elements
in such a group are of the form with The group is also
isomorphic to the group of symmetries of a regular -gon.
If with and we have
there is an automorphism such that and any automorphism of
is of this form. Thus where
4. Both and are left adjoint and preserve coproduts. we can have up to canonical
isomorphism since
