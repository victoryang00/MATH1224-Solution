($\rightarrow$)  First A field of characteristic 0 is perfect. Then let $F$ be a field of characteristic $p \neq 0$. Suppose that a and $b$ are elements of $\mathrm{F}$. Then $(a+b)^{p}=a^{p}+b^{p} .$ In particular, the function $\Phi_{F}: F \rightarrow F$ defined by $\Phi_{F}(x)=x^{p}$ is a homomorphism.

Proof. Expand $(a+b)^{p}$ using the binomial theorem. All of the binomial coefficients are divisible by $p$, except for the first and last ones.

($\leftarrow$)  First, let $F$ be field and let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial. If $f(x)$ is not separable then $f^{\prime}(x)=0$.

Proof. Suppose that $f(x)$ is not separable and that $f^{\prime}(x) \neq 0$. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible, and $f^{\prime}(x)$ has lower degree than $f(x)$, the greatest common divisor of $f$ and $f^{\prime}$ is 1 . Let $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ be polynomials in $F[x]$ such that $a(x) f(x)+b(x) f^{\prime}(x)=1$.

Since $f$ is not separable, there is an extension $K$ of $F$ such that $f$ has a repeated root $\alpha \in K$. Thus in $K[x]$ we have $f(x)=(x-\alpha)^{2} h(x)$. By the product rule, $f^{\prime}(x)=$ $2(x-\alpha) h(x)+(x-\alpha)^{2} h^{\prime}(x)$. Thus $f(\alpha)=f^{\prime}(\alpha)=0$
Since the equation $a(x) f(x)+b(x) f^{\prime}(x)=1$ holds in $F[x]$, it also holds in $K[x]$ when we regard $a, b, f$ and $f^{\prime}$ as polynomials in $K[x]$. But this is absurd since $a(\alpha) f(\alpha)+$ $b(\alpha) f^{\prime}(\alpha)=0$ in $K[x]$. This contradiction shows that $f^{\prime}(x)=0$.

Then let $F$ be field and let $f(x) \in F[x]$ be a polynomial of positive degree. If $f^{\prime}(x)=0$ then Char $F=p$ for some prime $p$ and $f(x)=g\left(x^{n p}\right)$ for some $n>0$ and some polynomial $g(x)$ with $g^{\prime}(x) \neq 0 .$ In particular, if $f$ is monic and irreducible, but not separable, then $f(x)=g\left(x^{n p}\right)$ where $n>0$ and $g$ is monic, irreducible and separable.
Proof. Suppose that $f^{\prime}(x)=0 .$ Write $f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1} x+\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}$. Consider a monomial $a_{k} x^{k}$ where $a_{k} \neq 0 .$ Since $f^{\prime}(x)=0$ we have $k a_{k} x^{k}=0$, so $F$ must have non-zero characteristic $p$ and $k$ must be divisible by $p$. Thus the non-zero monomials in $f$ all have degree divisible by $p$. Let $n p$ be the greatest common divisor of the degrees of the non-zero monomials that occur in $f$. We have $f(x)=g\left(x^{n p}\right)$, where the coefficients of $g$ are the same as those of $f$, but of different degree. There is at least one non-zero monomial in $g$ with degree not divisible by $p$. Thus $g^{\prime}(x) \neq 0$. Any factorization of $g$ yields a factorization of $f$ by substituting $x^{n p}$ for $x$. Thus $g$ is irreducible whenever $f$ is irreducible.

Finally, if $F$ is a field of characteristic $p \neq 0$ and if the Frobenius endomorphism
$\Phi_{F}: F \rightarrow F$ is surjective, then $F$ is perfect.

Proof. Let $F$ be a perfect field and consider a monic irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ of degree $m$. Suppose that $f(x)$ is not separable. Then, according to first 2 part we must have Char $F=p \neq 0$ and we can write $f(x)=g\left(x^{n p}\right)$ for some separable polynomial $g$. A polynomial in $x^{n p}$ can also be regarded as a polynomial in $x^{p}$, so it implies that $f(x)=h(x)^{p}$ for some polynomial $h(x) \in F[x]$. This contradicts the irreducibility of $f$.

### a.

Assume that all fields are of characteristic $p$. Suppose that $F / E_1$ is separable, and $E _1/ E$ is separable. Let $S$ be the set of all elements of $F$ that are separable over $E$. Then $E_1 \subseteq S$, since $E_1 / E$ is separable.

Note that $S$ is a subfield of $F$ : indeed, if $u, v \in S$ and $v \neq 0$, then $E(u, v)$ is separable over $E$ because it is generated by separable elements, so $u+v, u-v, u v$, and $u / v$ are all separable over $E$. So $S$ is a field.

I claim that $F$ is purely inseparable over $S$. Indeed, if $u \in F$, then there exists $n \geq 0$ such that $u^{p^{n}}$ is separable over $E$, hence there exists $n \geq 0$ such that $u^{p^{n}} \in S$. Therefore, the minimal polynomial of $u$ over $S$ is a divisor of $x^{p^{n}}-u^{p^{n}}=(x-u)^{p^{n}}$, so $F$ is purely inseparable over $S$.
But since $E_1 \subseteq S \subseteq F$, and $F$ is separable over $E_1$, then it is separable over $S .$ So $F$ is both purely inseparable and separable over $S$. This can only occur if $S=F$, hence every element of $S$ is separable over $E$.

Given the equivalent of above. If the implication holds for all finite dimensional extensions, then we would have that $E_1\left(u_{1}, \ldots, u_{n}\right)$ is a Galois extension of $E_1$, and therefore there exist $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}\left(E_1\left(u_{1}, \ldots, u_{n}\right)\right)$ such that $\tau(u) \neq u$. Since $E_2$ is a splitting field over $E_1$, it is also a splitting field over $E_1\left(u_{1}, \ldots, u_{n}\right)$, and therefore $\tau$ extends to an automorphism of $E_2$. Thus, there exists $\tau \in \operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2)$ such that $\tau(u) \neq u$. This would prove that the fixed field of $\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2)$ is $E_1$, so the extension is Galois. Thus, we are reduced to proving the implication when $[E_2: E_1]$ is finite. When $[E_2: E_1]$ is finite, there is a finite subset of $T$ that will suffice to generate $E_2$. Moreover, $\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2)$ is finite. If $E$ is the fixed field of $\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2)$, then by Artin's Theorem $E_2$ is Galois over $E$ and $\operatorname{Gal}(E_2 / E)=\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2) .$ Hence, $[E_2: E]=\left|\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2)\right|$
Thus, it suffices to show that when $E_2$ is a finite extension of $E_1$ and is a splitting field of a finite set of separable polynomials $g_{1}, \ldots, g_{m} \in E_1[x]$, then $[E_2: E_1]=\left|\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2)\right| .$ Replacing the set with the set of all irreducible factors of the $g_{i}$, we may assume that all $g_{i}$ are irreducible.

We do induction on $[E_2: E_1]=n .$ If $n=1$, then the equality is immediate. If $n>1$, then some $g_{i}$, say $g_{1}$, has degree greater than 1 ; let $u \in E_2$ be a root of $g_{1} .$ Then $[E_1(u): E_1]=\operatorname{deg}\left(g_{1}\right)$, and the number of distinct roots of $g_{1}$ in $E_2$ is $\operatorname{deg}\left(g_{1}\right)$, since $g_{1}$ is separable. Let $H=\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1(u)}(E_2)$. Define a map from the set of left cosets of $H$ in $\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2)$ to the set of distinct roots of $g_{1}$ in $E_2$ by mapping $\sigma H$ to $\sigma(u)$. This is one-to-one, since $\sigma(u)=\rho(u) \Longrightarrow \sigma^{-1} \rho \in H \Longrightarrow \sigma H=\rho H$. Therefore,
$\left[\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2): H\right] \leq \operatorname{deg}\left(g_{1}\right) .$ If $v \in E_2$ is any other root of $g_{1}$, then there is an isomorphism $\tau: E_1(u) \rightarrow E_1(v)$ that fixes $E_1$ and maps $u$ to $v$, and since $E_2$ is a splitting field, $\tau$ extends to an automorphism of $E_2$ over $E_1$. Therefore, the map from cosets of $H$ to roots of $g_{1}$ is onto, so $\left[\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2): H\right]=\operatorname{deg}\left(g_{1}\right)$
We now apply induction: $E_2$ is the splitting field over $E_1(u)$ of a set of separable polynomials (same one as we started with), and $[E_2: E_1(u)]=[E_2: E_1] / \operatorname{deg}\left(g_{1}\right)<[E_2: E_1]$. Therefore, $[E_2: E_1(u)]=\left|\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1(u)}(E_2)\right|=|H|$
Hence $\left|\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2)\right|=\left[\operatorname{Aut}_{E_1}(E_2): H\right]|H|=\operatorname{deg}\left(g_{1}\right)[E_2: E_1(u)]=[E_1(u): E_1][E_2: E_1(u)]=[E_2: E_1]$, and we are done.

Proof. Choose a basis $S$ for $E_{1}$ over $E$, and consider the subset $E$ of $F$ consisting of linear combinations of the elements of $S$ with coefficients in $E_{2}$ :
$$
E=\left\{\sum_{s \in S} \lambda_{s} s \mid \lambda_{s} \in E_{2}\right\}
$$
Since 1 is in $\bar{E}_{1}$ and $S$ spans $\bar{E}_{1}$ over $E$, there are elements $\epsilon_{s}$ of $E$ such that
$$
1=\sum_{s \in S} \epsilon_{s} s
$$
Hence for any $x$ in $E_{2}$,
$$
x=\sum_{s \in S}\left(x \epsilon_{s}\right) s
$$
is an element of $E$. Since $E_{1}$ is closed under multiplication, for every $t$ and $u$ in $S$ there are elements $\mu_{s}^{t, u}$ of $E$ such that
$$
t u=\sum_{s \in S} \mu_{s}^{t, u} s
$$
Hence for elements $x=\sum_{s \in S} \lambda_{s} s$ and $y=\sum_{s \in S} \nu_{s} s$ of $E$,
$$
x+y=\sum_{s \in S}\left(\lambda_{s}+\nu_{s}\right) s
$$
is in $E$ and
$$
\begin{aligned}
x y=\sum_{t \in S, u \in S} \lambda_{t} \nu_{u} t u &=\sum_{t \in S, u \in S} \lambda_{t} \nu_{u}\left(\sum_{s \in S} \mu_{s}^{t, u} s\right) \\
&=\sum_{s \in S}\left(\sum_{t \in S, u \in S} \lambda_{t} \nu_{u} \mu_{s}^{t, u}\right) s
\end{aligned}
$$
is an element of $E .$ So $E$ contains $E_{2}$ and is closed under addition and multiplication. Eurthermore, $S$ spans $E$ as a vector space over $E_{2}$, so $E$ is finitedimensional over $E_{2}$, of dimension at most $|S|=\left[E_{1}: E\right] .$ Hence by Lemma $2.4, E$ is a subfield of $F$. Since $E$ contains both $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$, and is generated by elements of $E_{1} E_{2}, E=E_{1} E_{2} .$ By the Tower Law, $E_{1} E_{2} / E$ is finite, and $\left[E_{1} E_{2}: E\right]=\left[E_{1} E_{2}: E_{2}\right]\left[E_{2}: E\right] \leq\left[E_{1}: E\right]\left[E_{2}: E\right]$ as required

The largest Field is $\mathrm{F}\left(X^{\frac{1}{2 p}}\right)$.

Proof. Let $\zeta$ be the primitive $n$ -th root in $F$. We have $(-\zeta)^{2 n}=1$. Note that $\zeta \neq-\zeta$ because $\operatorname{char}(F) \neq 2$. Let us denote $-\zeta$ by $\omega$ and we claim that $\omega$ is the required primitive $2 n$ -th root of unity. If not, let $\omega$ be a primitive $d$ -th root of unity for $d<2 n$. Hence
$$
\omega^{d}=1 \Rightarrow \zeta^{d}=(-1)^{d} .
$$
Now there are two possibilities. If $d$ is odd, then
$$
\zeta^{d}=-1 \Rightarrow \zeta^{2 d}=1 \Rightarrow n \mid 2 d
$$
(by definition of $\zeta$ ). As $n$ is odd, we must have $n \mid d$. Hence the only possibility is $d=n$, but clearly $\omega^{n} \neq 1 .$ So we arrive at a contradiction. If $d$ is even, then
$$
\zeta^{d}=1 \Rightarrow n \mid d
$$
Following the same argument as before we again arrive at a contradiction. Hence $\omega$ is the required $2 n$ -th root of unity contained in $F$.
