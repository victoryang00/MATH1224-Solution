1. The homomorphism $f$ from $\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$ to $\mathbb{Z} / m \mathbb{Z}$ iff $g=\text{gcd}(m,n)>1$. 

   For $g=1$ is the trivial case. Because the homomorphism is determined by $f(\bar{1})$. According to the Lagrange's theorem, the order of $f(\bar{1})$ should be divide by both $m$ and $n$. So the order of $f$ is 1. 

   For $g>1$, let $k=\frac m g$, we have that $f(\bar a)=\bar {ka}$ then $a=b+xn$ for some integer $x$ and then $f(\bar{a})=\bar{k(b+xn)}=\bar{kb}+\bar{kxn}=f(\bar b)$. Also, $kxn$ is divisible by $m$: $kxn = \frac m g xn = mx\frac m g$. Also, $f(\bar a + \bar b)= f(\bar{a+b})=\bar{k(a+b)} = f(\bar a)+f(\bar b)$.

   a.

   Denote the hormophism from $G_i\rightarrow \prod_{i \in \mathrm{I}} \mathrm{G}_{i}$ be $H_i$ Let $e_{G}$ be the identity for $\left(G, *\right)$.
   Let $e_{H}$ be the identity for $(H, *_{2})$.

   $(g, h) \circ\left(e_{G}, e_{H}\right)=\left(g *_{1} e_{G}, h_{* 2} e_{H}\right)=(g, h)$
   $\left(e_{G}, e_{H}\right) \cdot(g, h)=\left(e_{G} *_{1} g, e_{H} *_{2} h\right)=(g, h)$

   Thus $(e_G,e_H)$ is the identity of the group direct product. Thus the direct product of groups are groups.

   b.

   Suppose the groups here are finite groups. Denote the homophism $H_1$, $H_2$ ... $H_n$ are n normal subgroup of $G$.

   The direct sum is commutative up to isomorphism. of $G=\Sigma H_i$ we have $\forall g_i \text{ in } H_1, g_i^{\prime} \text{ in } H_2$, we have $g_i*g_i^\prime =g_i^\prime *g_i$ and $\exist$ one $g_i$ and $g_i^\prime$ s.t. $\left(g_{i}\right)_{i \in \mathrm{I}} *\left(g_{i}^{\prime}\right)_{i \in \mathrm{I}}*...(g_{i}^{n\prime })_{i \in \mathrm{I}}:=\left(g_{i} *_{i} g_{i}^{\prime}... *_{i} g_{i}^{n\prime}\right)_{i \in \mathrm{I}}$ also, the cancellation of the sum in a quotient, so that $(\Sigma H_i+H_2)/H_2$ is isomorphic to $\Sigma H_i$

   From above, we have multiplication of elements in a direct sum is isomorphic to multiplication of the corresponding elements. Thus, from $a$, we have the direct sum of groups are groups.

   ii.

   By Lagrange theorem: [$S_3:S_3 ^{\prime}$]=2 and $S_3^{\prime}\leq ker \phi$ So $S_3/ker\phi$ has order at most 2. Let $\phi$ be $S_3\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_6$. The possible kernels are $\{e\},A_3$ and $S_3$.

   First $\{e\}$ is the trivial case but the order is 1, so just circle out.

   Then Check for $S_{3},$ then $S_{3} / S_{3}$ is identity, so you can map every element of $S_{3}$ to the
   identity of $ \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ . $\phi(s)=0, \forall s \in S_{3}$ and 0 is the identity of $\mathbb{Z}_{6} .$

   The last is $A_3,$ the order of the far group is 2, Using isomorphism theorem: $S_3/A_3\simeq \phi(S_3)$. Then $\phi(S_3)$ is $\{3,0\}$ 

   Thus all normal subgroups are $A_{3} \text { and } S_{3}$.

3. $\forall a \in  \mathbb{Q}$ there exists some non-zero element \(r\) in $\mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $r a \in \mathbb{Z} .$ But we know that every \(a\) can be written as $x / y,$ where $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ thus we can always take $r=y$ and we canthen c onclude that every $\mathbb{Q} / \mathbb{Z}$ is a torsion group.

   Let $H$ be a non-zero subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $0\neq h = \frac m n \in H$, It's clear that $m = n\cdot h \in H$ and $\mathbb Z < H$ we have $h \mathbb{Q} \subseteq H$, so that $G/H$ is torsion, which $\simeq G$

4. First, we have $Aut(G)$ is $G/\mathbb{Z(G)}$ which is cylic. $\exist x\in G$, s.t. $G/\mathbb{Z(G)}=<x\mathbb{Z}(G)>$ 

   We can wrote that $x=g^kh$ for some $k$ and some $h\in \mathbb{Z}(G)$. Given $x,y \in G$ we have $x=g^kh$ and $y=g^\mathit l h^{\prime}$ Thus $xy=(g^kh)(g^\mathit l h^{\prime})=g^{k} g^{\ell} h h^{\prime} =\left(g^{\ell} h^{\prime}\right)\left(g^{k} h\right)=yx $ so that $G$ is abelian. $\square$

5. Find the subgroup of $G L_2( \mathbb{R})$ generated by the matrices $A$. $C(\mathbb{U}_2 (\not C/\mathbb{R}))=C\{A\in GL(\not C)\mid A^{-t} =A^{-1}\}$ which is $\simeq S^{\prime} = \{\left(\begin{array}{cc}z & 0 \\ 0 & z\end{array}\right)\mid |z| =1\}$

   So that where the matrix can be $\left(\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)$ or $\left(\begin{array}{cc}-1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1\end{array}\right)$.
