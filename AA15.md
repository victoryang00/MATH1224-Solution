By Gauss' Lemma we have that the polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it's irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}$. Now the easiest way would be to prove that polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, which would be enough.

Assume it's reducible. As the polynomial has no roots over $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$, then the only possibility is if it's a product of polynomials of degree 2 and $3 .$ So assume that:
$$
x^{5}-9x+3=\left(x^{3}+a x^{2}+b x+c\right)\left(x^{2}+d x+e\right) \quad \text { over } \mathbb{Z}_{2}
$$
Then multiply everything out and compare the factors. As $a, b, c, d, e \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}$, you only have two options. Eventually you will get that $ce=3$ and $a+d=0$, $ad+b=0$, $cd+be=3$. But this would imply that $c+b d+e a=a^{2}-9a+3=1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$. But this is impossible, as it's the coefficient in front of $x^{2}$ and it should be 0 .
Hence the polynomial is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ and eventually $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$

1. Let $P=x^5-9x+3$ and A=max{$|1|,|-9|,|3|$}=9. So that when $|x|>1$, we have $|-9x+1|<9$. So that when $|x|\geq 10$ , we have $|x|^5>|-9x+3|$. Thus $P(|x|)>0$, $P(-|x|)<0$ and $x\geq10$. Thus P have 3 reel roots.

2. a) Then to prove that it has 2 non-reel roots. For any real polynomial that degree greater than 0, it has non-reel roots.

Let $\alpha=p+q i$.
Let $p+q i$ be expressed in exponential form as $\alpha=r e^{i \theta}$.
As $\alpha=r e^{i \theta}$ satisfies $f(\alpha)=0$, it follows that:
$$
a_{n} r^{n} e^{n i \theta}+a_{n-1} r^{n-1} e^{(n-1) i \theta}+\cdots+a_{1} r e^{i \theta}+a_{0}=0
$$
Taking the conjugate of both sides:
$$
a_{n} r^{n} e^{-n i \theta}+a_{n-1} r^{n-1} e^{-(n-1) i \theta}+\cdots+a_{1} r e^{-i \theta}+a_{0}=0
$$
it follows that $\bar{\alpha}=p-q i$ is also a root of $f$.
If any of the $a_{k}$ are complex, then the conjugate of $f$ is not the same polynomial as $f$.
Therefore there's multiple of 2 conjugate non-reel roots.

b) since $P\in\Q[x]$ So $P=m_\Q(x_1)(x)$ $\rightarrow[\Q(x_1):\Q]=deg P=5$. Because of Tower Law, $[L:\Q]=[L:\Q(x_1)][\Q(x_1):\Q]$ Thus $5=[\Q(x_1):\Q]|[L:\Q]$

Since $|Gal(L/\Q)|=[L:\Q]$, $5|[Gal(L/Q)]$

Thus there's 5 roots, 2 are non-reel, 3 are reel.

if $p\in P$ and $p|\ |G|<\infty$ then $\exist a\in G$ s.t. $|a|=p$. So $\exist a\in Gal(L/ \Q)$ s.t. $|a|=p$. By restricting on {$x_1..x_5$}, this means $\exist \sigma$ 5-cycle$\in S_5$ s.t. $a|${$x_1,...x_5$}=$\sigma$. 

And $b\in Gal(L/\Q)$ a+bi $^b_\rightarrow$ a-bi  is a $\Q$-automorphism. let b|{$x_1,...x_5$} $x_4\rightarrow x_5$. and $x_5\rightarrow x_4$. with transposition $\tau=(x_4,x_5)$.

Claim: every permutation in $S_5$ is attained.

Proof: They are $\sigma \tau\sigma^{-1},\sigma^2 \tau\sigma^{-2},\sigma ^3\tau\sigma^{-3},\sigma ^4\tau\sigma^{-4}$ and their products are within the group where $\tau$ is a 5-cycle, $\tau$ is a transposition. the num of all elements are 120.

Conclustion: $Gal(L/K) \simeq S_5$

Observe that all 3 -cycles are conjugate in $S_{5}$. Moreover, the normalizer of a 3-cycle contains both odd and even permutations. For example the normalizer of $(1,2,3)$ contains $(4,5)$ which is an odd permutation. So for any $g \in S_{5}, g(1,2,3) g^{-1}=g(4,5)(1,2,3)(4,5)^{-1} g^{-1}$. So any $S_{5}$ -conjugate of $(1,2,3)$ can be realized in $A_{5}$ (since for any $g \in S_{5}$ either $g \in A_{5}$ or $\left.g(4,5) \in A_{5}\right)$ Thus $[S_5,S_5]=A_5$

Observe that all permutations which contain two 2-cycles are conjugate in $S_{5}$. Moreover, the normalizer of such a permuation contains both odd and even permutations. For example, the normalizer of $(1,2)(3,4)$ contains $(1,2)$ which is odd. So the same argument as in the previous paragraph shows that all permutations which contain two 2-cycles are conjugate in $A_{5} .$
Because the normalizer of a 5 -cycle is contained in $A_{5}$, it follows that not all 5 -cycles are conjugate in $A_{5}$. Because $A_{5}$ has index 2 in $S_{5}$ there are 2 conjugacy classes of 5 -cycles in $A_{5}$ and they have the same cardinality, $5 ! /(5 * 2)=12$ each.

Thus $[A_5,A_5]=A_5$
