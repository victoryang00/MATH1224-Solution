First define the polynomial $f_{S}(x)$ is called the minimal polynomial of $S$ (over $\left.F\right)$.

Then consider the unique map $\phi_S:F[x]\rightarrow E$ which is the identity on $F$ and sends $x$ to $S$. As $\phi_S$ is a ring homomorphism,  it send a polynomial $f(x)$ to $f(S)$. The image of $\phi_S$ contains $F$ and $S$ and is the smallest. Thus $F[S]\cong F[x] / \operatorname{ker}\left(\varphi_{S}\right)$. Now, $S$ is algebraic iff $\phi_S$ has a non-trivial kernel and the kernel is generated by a polynomiala $f_S(x)$ of positive degree that we may simply choose to be monic. If $f_S(x)=f(x)g(x)$ is a proper factorization of $f_S(x)$, then by CRT, $F[x] /\left(f_{S}(x)\right) \cong F[x] /(f(x)) \times F[x] /(g(x))$. The RHS the product of non-zero rings can not be a field. Thus $f_S(x)$ is irreducible and  $F[x]$ is a PID, the ideal $((f_S(x)))$ is maximal, so $F[S] \cong F[x] /\left(f_{S}(x)\right)$ is a field. Thus $F[S]=F(S)$.

But not for infinite $S$, because let $E / F, E=F(u)$, be a simple field extension. Then $u$ is algebraic if and only if $E / F$ is finite. In this case, $[E: F]=\operatorname{deg} f_{u} .$

Proof. If $u$ is transcendental, then $1, u, u^{2}, \ldots$ are linearly independent because otherwise we would obtain a polynomial $f \in F[x], f \neq 0$, with $f(u)=0$.

If $u$ is algebraic and $n=\operatorname{deg} f_{u}$, then I claim that $1, u, \ldots, u^{n-1}$ is a basis of $E$ as an $F$ -vector space. To confirm this, observe first of all that these elements are linearly independent, by the argument from the previous paragraph: if we had a linear relation $a_{0}+a_{1} u+$ $\ldots+a_{n-1} u^{n-1}=0$ with coefficients $a_{j} \in F$, not all equal to zero, then we would obtain a (monic, after division by the highest non-zero coefficient) polynomial $g \in F[x], g \neq 0$, with $g(u)=0, \operatorname{deg} g<n$ but this contradicts the definition of the minimal polynomial as the polynomial of smallest possible degree for which this happens.

To see that $1, u, \ldots, u^{n-1}$ span $E$, recall that $E=F[u]$, so any element of $E$ is a linear combination of powers $u^{j}, j \geq 0$. Now from $f_{u}(u)=0$, we obtain a formula of the type $u^{n}=b_{n-1} u^{n-1}+\ldots+b_{0}$. So powers $u^{j}$ with $j \geq n$ may be expressed in terms of powers with smaller exponents, and by applying this repeatedly, we can completely eliminate powers $u^{j}$ with $j \geq n$ from the linear combination.

$\Q$ has characteristic 0 and is countable by a famous spiral argument.

A field $K$ has characteristic 0 if and only if $\mathbb{Q}$ is a subfield of $K$
So, the way I have approached this is by first assuming that $K$ has characteristic 0 and then we know that there is an embedding of $\mathbb{Z}$
into $\mathrm{K}$ and since $n .1$ is in $\mathrm{K}$, then, their inverses will also be in $K$ and
hence the subfield that we get is the one generated by 1 and this is the prime subfield of $K$ and this is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}$. So $K$ contains
$\Q$. But I am not sure how to progress the other way.

As |$\Q$| <= |$\ZÃ—\Z$| and the latter is countable, $\Q$ is countable.

Let $E / F$ be a field extension. Define
$A=\{a \in E: a$ is algebraic over $F\}$
Then $A$ is a field, and $F \subseteq A \subseteq E$.
Proof. The inclusions are clear because every $a \in F$ is algebraic, with minimal polynomial $f_{a}=x-a .$ So we must show that $A$ is a subfield of $E .$ Let $a, b \in A .$ We must show that then $a-b$ and $a b^{-1}($ if $b \neq 0)$ are in $A$ as well.

Now $F(a, b) / F$ is a finite extension, by the same arguments as in the previous proof (adjoin $a, b$ separately and successively and observe that each individual extension is finite). Moreover, $a-b, a b^{-1} \in F(a, b)$, so $F(a-b) \subseteq F(a, b)$ also is a finite extension of $F$, and thus $a-b$ is algebraic by  __1.but__  (and similarly for $a b^{-1}$ ).

Proof. We know from above that if $\phi: E \rightarrow L$ extends $\sigma$, then $\phi(\alpha)$ must be a root of $f_{\alpha}^{\sigma}(x)$ showing that the number of $\phi$ is at most the number of distinct roots of $f_{\alpha}(x)$. On the other hand, given a root $\beta$ of $f^{\sigma}$ in $\Omega$, there is a unique homomorphism $F[x] \rightarrow L$ that agrees with $\sigma$ on $F$ and sends $x$ to $\beta$ (this is the freeness property of the polynomial algebra composed with the isomorphism $\left.F[x] \cong F^{\sigma}[x]\right) .$ Since $K=F(\alpha) \cong F[x] /\left(f_{\alpha}(x)\right) \cong F^{\sigma}[x]\left(f_{\alpha}^{\sigma}(x)\right)$ and $f_{\alpha}^{\sigma}(\beta)=0$ (i.e. the kernel of the map $F[x] \rightarrow \Omega$ is contained in $\left.\left(f_{\alpha}(x)\right)\right)$, the universal property of quotients yields a unique homomorphism $\phi: E \rightarrow L$ agreeing with $\sigma$ on $F$ and sending $\alpha$ to $\beta$.
