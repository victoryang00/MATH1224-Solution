First, we have $[F_3(T,S):F_3[X,Y]]=9$. because T and S is algebraic no relation, so is X and Y. X and Y are the prime element of $F[T,S]$. So $X^3-T^3$ is the irreducible element of F. So $[F_3(T):F_3[X,Y]]=3$

Also, we have $[F_3(T)(S):F_3[X,Y]]=3$ So $[F_3(T,S):F_3[X,Y]]=9$.

If there exist a element, say $\theta$ in $F_3$ to $F$ is the element. So that $\theta=\frac{f(T,S)}{g(T,S)}. f(T,S),g(T,S)\in F_3(T,S)$ So that $\theta ^3 = \frac{f(T^3,S^3)}{g(T^3,S^3)}\in F$. Which $[F(\theta): F]\leq 3<9$.  [⨳](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2a33/index.htm)

Let $E$ is the splitting field of $x^7-9\in \Q[x]$.  We have the roots in $\C$: $X=(-3)^{\frac27}$,$-i3^{\frac27}$, $-(-1)^{\frac37}3^\frac27$ ,$X=(-1)^{4 / 7} 3^{2 / 7}$
$X=-(-1)^{5 / 7} 3^{2 / 7}$

And let $\alpha=^7\sqrt9,\epsilon=cos \frac{2\pi}7 +i\ sin \frac{2\pi}7$. We have 

$Irr(\alpha,\Q)=x^7-9=\prod \limits_{k=0}^7(x-\alpha\epsilon^k)$

$Irr(\epsilon,\Q)=\prod \limits_{k=0}^7(x-\epsilon^k)$

Notice that let $E=\Q(\alpha,\epsilon), $$1\notin\{\frac{\epsilon^k-\epsilon}{\alpha(1-\epsilon^i)}|1\leq i,k\leq 4\}$ So that Let $\theta=\alpha+\epsilon$, we have $E=\Q(\theta)$, 

Let $E_1$ be one of the automorphism of $E$, which have the relation of $E\sub E_1\sub \Q.$ $\eta (3^{\frac27})=\alpha^k 3^{\frac27}，k=0-6$ and $\eta (\alpha)=\alpha^k ，k=1-6$. Let $E_1=\eta(k=2)$. Because $E_1$ is the splitting field of  $\{Irr(\alpha,\Q)|\alpha\in E\}$  and $Irr(\alpha,\Q)$ is the polynomial of $\Q$. Thus $E_1$ is the splitting field of  $\{Irr(\alpha,\Q)\in E[x]|\alpha\in E\}$, So that $E_1|\Q$ are normal.

The fixed field of $\{e\}$ is $K$, while the fixed field of $\langle\sigma, \tau\rangle=\operatorname{Gal}(K / \mathbb{Q})$ is $\mathbb{Q}$ by condition $(3)$ of the
characterization of Galois extensions.
For the other fixed fields we can either compute the action explicitly on a basis (which is straightforward, if tedious) or try to identify elements of $K$ that might generate some of these fields, and then exploit the Galois action. For example, observe that $\sigma$ stabilizes $3^{1 / 5}$, and since the fixed field corresponding to $\sigma$ must have degree 4 over $\mathbb{Q}$, it must be equal to $\mathbb{Q}\left(3^{1 / 5}\right) .$ Notice that $\langle\sigma\rangle$ is normal in the Galois group, and indeed $\mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{3}\right)$ is Galois over $\mathbb{Q}$. Likewise, we can see that $\tau$ stabilizes $3^{1 / 2}$, and since the fixed field of $\tau$ must have degree 3 over $\mathbb{Q}$, it must be $\mathbb{Q}\left(3^{1 / 2}\right)$.

The normal hull is as follows

Intersections of subgroups correspond to joins of fields, and joins of subgroups correspond to intersections of fields.

Proof: Suppose that $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ are subgroups of $F$ with respective fixed fields $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$.Then any element in $H_{1} \cap H_{2}$ fixes both $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ hence fixes everything in $E_{1} E_{2}$ (since the elements of the composite field are rational functions of elements of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ ).Conversely, any automorphism fixing $E_{1} E_{2}$ must in particular fix both $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ hence be contained in $H_{1} \cap H_{2}$. Thus, $H_{1} \cap H_{2}=E_2$ corresponds to $E_{1} E_{2}$.

 Similarly, $E_{1} \cap E_{2}$ is fixed by any element in $H_{1}$ or $H_{2}$, hence also by any word in such elements, so $\left\langle H_{1}, H_{2}\right\rangle$ fixes $E_{1} \cap E_{2}$  Inversely, if $\sigma$ is any automorphism that does not fix $E_{1} \cap E_{2}$, then for any $h \in H_{1} \cup H_{2}$ we see that $\sigma h$ also does not fix $E_{1} \cap E_{2}$Then by an easy induction argument on the word length, we see that $\sigma$ cannot be written as a word in $\left\langle H_{1}, H_{2}\right\rangle$. Thus, $\left\langle H_{1}, H_{2}\right\rangle$ corresponds to $E_{1} \cap E_{2}=F$.

Thus $|E_1|F|=|E_1E_2|E_2|$.
