1. a) $|G|=1$, the case is trivial group

   b) Assume $|G|>1$ then there's $a\in G$, but all groups have inverses so $a^{-1}\in G$, which indicates that $|G|\geq 3$, but the case would be abelian so there should be another element $b\in G$ and also, it's inverse, and we have that $|G|\geq 5$. 

   c) We have that $ab\in G$. So that we may give one of the following:

   ​	1) $ab=a$ or $ab=b$ which indicates that they can be eliminated as they imply that either $a$ or $b$ are identity or inverse

   ​    3) $ab =e$ or $ab=a^{-1}$ or $ab=b^{-1}$ which indicates that they can be eliminated for that $aba=a^2b=e$ with left and right $a$ multiplication on $ab=a^{-1}$. 

   So that $ab=ba$ for the elements which clearly aren't abelian.

   Thus $|G|\geq6\ \square$
