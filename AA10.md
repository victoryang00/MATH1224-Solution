Prop 103: Let $^\sim_N$ be a Euuclidian function on A. Define N(a)=$min\{^\sim_N(ba)\mid b\in A\backslash \{0\} \}$. Then $N$ is a Euclidian Funclion.



Proof: Euclidean norm $^\sim_N$ be an Euclidean domain.
1. Then,
$$
N(1)=\min \{^\sim_N(x): x \in A, x \neq 0\}
$$
2. For $b \in A \backslash \{0\}$ we have
$$
b \text { is a unit } \Longleftrightarrow ^\sim_N(b)=^\sim_N(1) \text { . }
$$
Then $N$ is a Euclidian Function.

Proof. (1) follows from the second property of $^\sim_N$ as follows:
$$
\forall a \in D, a \neq 0 \quad ^\sim_N(1) \leq ^\sim_N(1 a)=^\sim_N(a)
$$
To prove $(2)$ suppose $b \in ^\sim_N$ is a unit. Then,
$$
^\sim_N(1) \leq ^\sim_N(u) \leq ^\sim_N\left(b b^{-1}\right)=^\sim_N(1) . \quad S o \quad ^\sim_N(b)=^\sim_N(1)
$$
Conversely, suppose $^\sim_N(1)=^\sim_N(b) .$ Se divide $!$ by $u$, we have $1=b q+r \quad$ for some $q, r \in D \quad \ni \quad r=0$ or $^\sim_N(r)<^\sim_N(u)$. Since $^\sim_N(u)=^\sim_N(1)$ is minimum, $r=0 .$ So, $1=b q .$ So, $b$ is a unit. The proof is complete.

### a.

Suppos e $A$ is a $UFD$ with the field F, Then a non-constant polynomial $p_1$ in $A[x]$ is irreducible iff it's irreducible in $F[x]$ and the gcd of the coefficient of $p_1$ is 1.

Proof:  First note that the gcd of the coefficients of $p_1$ is 1 since, otherwise, we can factor out some element $c \in A$ from the coefficients of $p_1$ to write $p_1=c p_1^{\prime}$, contradicting the irreducibility of $p_1$. Next, suppose $p_1=p_2 p_3$ for some non-constant polynomials $p_2, p_3$ in $F\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$. Then, for some $d \in A$, the polynomial $d p_2$ has coefficients in $A$ and so, by factoring out the gcd $q$ of the coefficients, we write $d p_2=q p_2^{\prime}$. Do the same for $p_3$ and we can write $p_1=c p_2^{\prime} p_3^{\prime}$ for some $c \in F$. Now, let $c=a / b$ for some $a, b \in A$. Then $b p_1=a p_2^{\prime} p_3^{\prime}$. From this, using the proposition, we get:
$(b) \supset \operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{cont}(b p_1))=(a) .$
That is, $b$ divides $a$. Thus, $c \in R$ and then the factorization $p_1=c p_2^{\prime} p_3^{\prime}$ constitutes a contradiction to the irreducibility of $p_1$.

For the other side. If $p_1$ is irreducible over $F$, then either it's irreducible over $A$ or it contains a constant polynomial as a factor. 

### b.

Suppose $A$ is a UFD with the field $F$,  $p_1p_2\in\Q(A)[X]\backslash \{0\}$.  Then $cont(p_1p_2)=cont(p_1)cont(p_2)$.

Proof: Clearly, $\operatorname{cont}(p_1 p_2) \subset \operatorname{cont}(p_1) \operatorname{cont}(p_2)$. If $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal containing $\operatorname{cont}(p_1p_2)$, then $p_1p_2 \equiv 0$ modulo $\mathfrak{p}$. Since $A / \mathfrak{p}\left[x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$ is a polynomial ring over an integral domain and thus is an integral domain, this implies either $p_1 \equiv 0$ or $p_2 \equiv 0$ (mod $\mathfrak{p}$). Hence, either $\operatorname{cont}(p_1)$ or $\operatorname{cont}(p_2)$ is contained in $\mathfrak{p}$. Since $\sqrt{\operatorname{cont}(p_1 p_2)}$ is the intersection of all prime ideals that contain $\operatorname{cont}(p_1 p_2)$ and the choice of $\mathfrak{p}$ was arbitrary, $\operatorname{cont}(p_1) \operatorname{cont}(p_2) \subset \sqrt{\operatorname{cont}(p_1 p_2)}$
We now prove the "moreover" part. Factoring out the gcd's from the coefficients, we can write $p_1=a p_1^{\prime}$ and $p_2=b p_2^{\prime}$ where the gcds of the coefficients of $p_1^{\prime}, p_2^{\prime}$ are both 1 . Clearly, it is enough to prove the assertion when $p_1, p_2$ are replaced by $p_1^{\prime}, p_2^{\prime}$; thus, we assume the gcd's of the coefficients of $p_1, p_2$ are both 1 . 

We have that if $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=\operatorname{gcd}(a, c)=1$, then $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b c)=1$
(The proof of the lemma is not trivial but is by elementary algebra.) We argue by induction on the sum of the numbers of the terms in $f, g$; that is, we assume the proposition has been established for any pair of polynomials with one less total number of the terms. Let ( $c$ ) $=\operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{cont}(p_1p_2))$; i.e., $c$ is the gcd of the coefficients of $p_1p_2$. Assume $(c) \neq(1)$; otherwise, we are done. Let $p_1^{\prime}, p_2^{\prime}$ denote the highest-degree terms of $p_1,p_2 $ in terms of lexicographical monomial ordering. Then $p_1^{\prime}p_2^{\prime}$ is precisely the leading term of $p_1p_2$ and so $c$ divides the (unique) coefficient of $p_1^{\prime}p_2^{\prime}$ (since it divides all the coefficients of $p_1p_2$ ). Now, if $c$ does not have a common factor with the (unique) coefficient of $p_1^{\prime}$ and does not have a common factor with that of $p_2^{\prime}$, then, by the above lemma, $\operatorname{gcd}\left(c, \operatorname{cont}\left(p_1^{\prime} p_2^{\prime}\right)\right)=(1)$. But $c$ divides the coefficient of $p_1^{\prime}p_2^{\prime}$; so this is a contradiction. Thus, either $c$ has a common factor with the coefficient of $p_1^{\prime}$ or does with that of $p_2^{\prime}$; say, the former is the case. Let $(d)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(c, \operatorname{cont}\left(p_1^{\prime}\right)\right)$. Since $d$ divides the coefficients of $p_1 p_2-p_1^{\prime} p_2=\left(p_1-p_1^{\prime}\right) p_2$, by inductive hypothesis,
$(d) \supset \operatorname{gcd}\left(\operatorname{cont}\left(\left(p_1-p_1^{\prime}\right) p_2^{\prime}\right)\right)=\operatorname{gcd}\left(\operatorname{cont}\left(p_1-p_1^{\prime}\right)\right) \operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{cont}(p_2))=\operatorname{gcd}\left(\operatorname{cont}\left(p_1-p_1^{\prime}\right)\right) .$
Since $(d)$ contains $\operatorname{cont}\left(p_1^{\prime}\right)$, it contains $\operatorname{cont}(p_1)$; i.e., $(d)=(1)$, a contradiction. 

 If $\operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{cont}(p_1p_2))=(1)$, then there is nothing to prove. So, assume otherwise; then there is a non-unit element dividing the coefficients of $p_1p_2$. Factorizing that element into a product of prime elements, we can take that element to be a prime element $\pi$. Now, we have:
$$
(\pi)=\sqrt{(\pi)} \supset \sqrt{\operatorname{cont}(p_1p_2)} \supset \operatorname{cont}(p_1) \operatorname{cont}(p_2)
$$
Thus, either $(\pi)$ contains $\operatorname{cont}(p_1)$ or $\operatorname{cont}(p_2)$; contradicting the gcd's of the coefficients of $p_1,p_2$ are both $1 . \square$

Basic theorem on symmetric polynomials: For a symmetric polynomial $F$ over any domain $f \in F\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right)$, there exists a polynomial $g\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{n}\right) \in F\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$ such that $f=g\left(\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \cdots, \sigma_{n}\right)$, that is, can be tabulated by the basic symmetric polynomial polynomial.
